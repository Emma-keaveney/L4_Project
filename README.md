# L4_Project
Code for Master's Project - 'In Pursuit of the Centres of Galaxies'.

This project looked at using data from the Auriga cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation to explore how galaxies interact with each other during close encounters and mergers, particularly tracking how the centres move during these events.

This repository contains some of the files I created during the project, including python files for the Auriga_Analysis package, and Jupyter notebooks used for analysis. The code was created for use with the COSMA supercomputer and specifically the simulation data stored there so cannot be run on other computers, however I believe the code here provides a good overview of the computational aspect of my work during the project.
